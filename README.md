# Winterfell

With the rise of customer data platform (CDP), API/Integration automation platform (such as Zapier), AI driven task automation (example: MS copilot studio, autoGPT) in Web2 world, onchain data and events are no longer silo in Starknet or Web3 system, they are also actionable in many ways: trigger event notification to other web2 platforms, trigger automations and dataflows, implement ETL taasks, trigger input for a LLMa or image/video request etc.

The idea of Winterfell project is to provide a platform allow user to filter and customize Starknet onchain account and event data, to automate a series tasks in web2 platforms.
